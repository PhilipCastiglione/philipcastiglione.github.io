<h1>Highlights</h1>
<ul><li>~5 years software development
</li><li>polyglot developer with multi-stack experience
</li><li>previous career in finance & management consulting
</li><li>superb academic record in Bachelor of Computer Science
</li><li>looking for early senior role I can grow in
</li></ul>
<br>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I'm approaching 5 years of professional software development:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>1.5 years at top tier software consultancy
</li><li>1 month interning at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute in Melbourne
</li><li>2 years SaaS product company
</li><li>1 year Digital Agency
</li><li>3 months teaching FE web development
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>I've focused on foundational skills that transfer between tech stacks and projects. I can spin up on languages/stacks and make valuable contributions quickly – I have had to demonstrate that repeatedly over the last 18 months, working in a software consultancy. I took my current job to continue to learn and level up fast.</p>
<br>
<p>The level I currently work at: I deliver robustly tested features and services, architect system components and contribute to major technical direction/decisions, mentor junior team members, contribute to product and business strategy.</p>
<br>
<p>I don't know how well these terms travel but, in Melbourne this is kind of an early senior level. Because it provides more context, my current total package is 126,651 AUD, which at today's conversion rate of 0.62 is 78,524 EUR. I realise markets aren't always equivalent but it might give you some more info about where I'm at.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>I actually did my first degree in Finance and worked in finance and management consulting for several years. However I always loved technology and tinkering with programming so I made the switch at the end of 2014. A number of soft skills have transferred and been invaluable; especially high quality communication and stakeholder management skills, which can make me very effective in contexts where some developers struggle. </p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p>I was self taught (& used a bootcamp to jumpstart the career change), so I decided to fill in gaps by doing Bachelor of Computer Science too. I've done that full time while working full time (blame my parents for my work ethic).  Thankfully just nearing the end of that now. I love the content and have 3 prizes and an excellence scholarship, including for having the highest grade across all students in the faculty.</p>
<br>
<p>The level I am aiming towards ~2-3 years from now: increasing leadership responsibility; accountability for major services and applications, managing teams.</p>
<br>
<h1>Specific Tech</h1>
<p>Stuff I've been paid to use a bunch:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>Ruby (Rails, also not Rails)
</li><li>Python (Flask, AI/ML eg tensorflow, keras, pylearn)
</li><li>JavaScript (Nodejs, clientside, SPA frameworks (React))
</li><li>TypeScript
</li><li>Postgres
</li><li>Redis
</li><li>AWS
</li><li>Docker
</li><li>BDD/TDD
</li><li>CI/CD pipelines
</li><li>Agile approaches
</li><li>Both microservices & monoliths
</li><li>Multiple paradigms (Classic OO & RDMBS, also event sourcing with DDD and CQRS)
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Stuff I've been paid to use a little bit:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>C#
</li><li>Scala
</li><li>Serverless (lambdas)
</li><li>GraphQL
</li><li>MySQL
</li><li>Heroku
</li><li>FP
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>Things I've spent some amount of personal time on within the last couple of years:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>C
</li><li>C++
</li><li>Java
</li><li>Dart (Flutter)
</li><li>Azure
</li><li>GCP
</li><li>...
</li></ul>
<br>
<h1>What I'm Looking For</h1>
<p>An employer I can be happy to join and stay with. I need sponsorship which I think relies on a 2+ year commitment at the outset. I am fairly flexible on tech stack as I'm confident I can learn the details of any stack – this is likely to concern prospective employers more than me. I'd probably avoid mobile development and PHP.</p>
<br>
<p>Primary concerns:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>strong team & good practices
</li><li>culture of learning
</li><li>salary (because this is usually linked with responsibility & opportunity)
</li><li>stable company
</li></ul>
<br>
<h1>Why Dublin?</h1>
<p>In order:</p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>My partner is Irish, comes from Dublin and wants to move home to family.
</li><li>I've lived in Melbourne for 10 years and I'm looking for a change.
</li><li>It looks fun and has a great tech scene!
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>Flights are booked for a 2 week visit over Oct/Nov to suss the place out. I'm roughly planning a move for the start of 2020.</p>
