## What Is Intelligence?
_16th September, 2016_

So we have set out to create Artificial Intelligence. Let's start right at the beginning though; AI is surely a tool,
not a goal. So, in fact, what is the goal?

This is worthy of a seperate article, but as a starting point maybe we can point to the old Deep Mind catchphrase?

> _"Solve Intelligence, then use that to solve everything else"_

Though obviously simplistic, this phrase illustrates the real objective: everything else. Progress towards solving the
world's existing problems and improving the capabilities and condition of the species in some way, great or small.
Accepting this as the initial premise, we can come back to clarify more specifically what our goal is when we have more
information.

So, with that out of the way, "intelligence". Artificial is sufficiently obvious in this context, but intelligence is
much more ambiguous in meaning. What is it we mean by intelligent? There are many competing definitions and agreement is
hard to find.

We need a definition that is:

1. measurable
1. does not define by negation (i.e. x is "not y")
1. does not include redundant information or red herrings
1. is not lacking in any essential element of the concept

After some limited research, the best definition I have so far is:

> _"Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."_

This is from [A Collection of Definitions of Intelligence](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1565458) by Legg & Hutter
(2007).

Examining the definition against our established criteria, it is:
1. sufficiently measurable (width in range of environments, success in achieving goals)
1. sufficiently specific and non-negative for a stipulative definition
1. very succinct

Does it describe the essential elements of the concept?

Well, that question is actually kind of the wrong way around. If the essential elements of the concept were clear and
well described, we would have our definition. Looking at what it has and what it doesn't have might at least lead us to
a level of confidence that this is a sufficient working definition.

This definition describes intelligence as itself being like a measure, rather than a capability one exercises. This is
highly appropriate to our purpose as we will use intelligence in a nebulous way to refer to a range of capabilities that
we want to measure.

Agency and goal seeking are arguably the outcomes of some deeper invisible feature described by intelligence rather
than descriptions of it, but this kind of definition by observation is also convenient for us. If we observe evidence
of agency and goal seeking then that is sufficient to initially infer their presence. For now at least this preferable
to attempting to deductively reason about the root causes of agency and purpose, better left to a seperate examination.

It's worth noting that the specific use of "wide range of environments" captures the essence of generalized
intelligence, pointedly distinct from the functioning of an entity or process highly specialized to a specific task.
This definition successfully identifies Deep Blue as unintelligent (though surely good at playing chess), in a
strangely similar way to how a praying mantis, though effective at achieving some little insecty goals, might be
considered unintelligent due to the limited range of environments and circumstances those goals are rooted in.

The major problem that I can see with this definition is that it possibly defers too much responsibility to one neat
word: goals. Any questions you ask of this definition regarding higher order thinking or more complex scenarios
including internal conflict are too simply answered with "achieve goals". If conceptual abstraction is important for
certain goals, then intelligence must imply it. If a conflict exists, it must be the case that there are multiple
conflicting goals.

This problem would be a signficant one if we were attempting to define what goals were purposeful or desirable.
However, given that we want only to achieve a workable definition of intelligence, the problem with this definition is
one we have already decided to defer for now. The problem might be addressed through an approach at the
[Value Loading Problem](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/26198) or alternatively might require a more fundamental
philosophical tack.

Nevertheless this is a tough, but seperate question. Intelligence we can accept as _the measurement of an agent's
ability to achieve goals, in a wide range of environments_.
