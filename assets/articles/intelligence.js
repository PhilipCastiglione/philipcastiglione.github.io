## What Is Intelligence?

So we have set out to create Artificial Intelligence. Let's start right at the beginning though; AI is surely a tool,
not a goal. So, in fact, what is the goal?

Maybe we can point to the old Deep Mind catchphrase?
> _"Solve Intelligence, then use that to solve everything else"_

Well, that's great. Though obviously simplistic. it's suitable as a starting point so we will accept this for now and
come back to clarify what we really mean another time.

So, "intelligence". Artificial is sufficiently obvious in this context, but intelligence is much more ambiguous in
meaning. What is it we mean by intelligent? There are many competing definitions and agreement is hard to find.

We need a definition that is:

1. measurable
1. does not define by negation (i.e. x is "not y")
1. sufficiently succinct to not include redundant information (or red herrings), but
1. that is not lacking in any essential element of the concept.

After doing a bit of searching, my current favourite definition is:

> _"Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments."_

This is from [A Collection of Definitions of Intelligence](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1565458) by Legg & Hutter
(2007).

Examining the definition against our established criteria, it is:
1. sufficiently measurable (width of environments range, accuracy/success in achieving goals)
1. sufficiently specific and non-negative for a stipulative definition
1. very succinct

Does it describe the essential elements of the concept? Well, that question is actually kind of the wrong way around.
If the essential elements of the concept were clear and well described, we would have our definition. Looking at what
it has and what it doesn't have might at least lead us to a level of confidence that this is a sufficient working
definitiion.

Adopting this definition, we describe intelligence as itself being like a measure, rather than a capability one
exercises. This is highly appropriate to our purpose.

Agency and goal seeking are arguably the outcomes of some deeper invisible feature described by intelligence rather
than descriptions of it, but this kind of definition by observation is also convenient for us for similar reasons.

It's worth noting that the specific use of "wide range of environments" nicely captures the essence of generalized
intelligence, pointedly distinct from the functioning of an entity or process highly specialized to a specific task.
This definition successfully identifies Deep Blue as unintelligent (though surely good at playing chess), in a
strangely similar way to how a praying mantis, though effective at achieving some little insecty goals, might be
considered unintelligent due to the limited range of environments and circumstances those goals are rooted in.

The major problem that I can see with this definition is that it possibly defers too much responsibility to one neat
word: goals. Any questions you ask of this definition regarding higher order thinking or more complex scenarios
including internal conflict are too simply answered with "achieve goals". If conceptual abstraction is important for
certain goals, then intelligence must imply it. If a conflict exists, it must be the case that there are multiple
conflicting goals.

This problem would be a signficant one if we were attempting to define what goals were purposeful or desirable.
However, given that we want only to achieve a workable definition of intelligence, the problem with this definition is
only the very same question chose to defer at the beginning of this process.

Choosing good goals is a tough, but seperate question. Intelligence at least, is the measurement of an agent's ability
to achieve those goals, once they are drawn from a wide pool of possible goals, in a wide range of environments.
