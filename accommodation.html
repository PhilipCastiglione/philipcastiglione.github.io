    Ireland Accommodation
  </h1>
  <p>
    Dublin is unfortunately not a cheap destination for accommodation. Depending on how long you're staying
    you might find different options that suit you. Also if you want to travel around and see different parts
    of Ireland we can give you loads of tips! Galway out on the west coast is very beautiful and it's only a
    2 hour drive across from Dublin.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a list of some places that are worth looking at based on location / price and recommendations.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are central city based options:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.claytonhotelburlingtonroad.com/" target="_blank">https://www.claytonhotelburlingtonroad.com/</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.number31.ie/" target="_blank">https://www.number31.ie/</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.ariel-house.net/" target="_blank">https://www.ariel-house.net/</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.thegibsonhotel.ie/" target="_blank">https://www.thegibsonhotel.ie/</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    There are also some nice B&Bs out where we live in Rush (north County Dublin), but that's a fair distance
    from the city so it depends what you want to see. You might look at Sandyhills B&B Rush if you are interested.
  </p>
  <p>
    Airbnb didn't seem great in terms of Dublin options. Outside of Dublin there are probably better options
    including large/shared accommodation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let us know if you would like any ideas in other locations outside of the city centre!

  <h2>
    The Wedding Night
  </h2>
  <p>
    There are 10 rooms reserved at the Clontarf Castle Hotel where we are celebrating the wedding. The hotel is
    pretty nice, the rooms are not cheap though at €179 (for a double/twin) for the night (breakfast for 2 included).
  </p>
  <p>
    We're not entirely clear if there is availability in the hotel before or after the wedding night itself (or if that
    discounted rate we have would apply). If you're interested in knowing about that please let us know and we can enquire.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively if you are staying centrally, the taxi fare back to your hotel will be reasonable (€15-€20).
  </p>
  <p>
    All the way back to Rush, the taxi fare will be more like €60-€70.
