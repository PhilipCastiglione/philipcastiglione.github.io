      <h2>The Search For Meaning</h2>
      <p>There are many developers around my age who started coding in their early teens shortly after the turn of the millenium. When I first discovered my love for programming at 26, I felt strong pangs of jealousy and regret that I had already <strong>wasted</strong> ten years of my life getting educated and working in a career I fundamentally never felt strongly about. I could have been programming all that time.</p>
      <p class="inset">Hell, even my own brother was one of these people. While I at 14 was staring vacantly into the distance, planning out my studies in Philosophy, he at that age had been adding C to his arsenal.</p>
      <p>Instead, my journey has been much less direct. When I got to uni, my Bachelor of Arts (Philosophy) transformed into a Bachelor of Arts/Commerce (Asian Studies/Accounting), then a Bachelor of Commerce (Finance) as I searched for something meaningful.<p>
      <p>I eventually settled for progress over passion, graduated with a high distinction average from a top ranked <a href="http://fbe.unimelb.edu.au/finance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">university</a> and begun a career in the borders of Finance and Management Consulting. Nice one. Theoretically. In fact, my business career was superficially successful, but ultimately deeply unfulfilling.<p>
      <p>After a number of years, I finally decided enough was enough and that I had to sacrifice convention for happiness. I quit my job and enrolled in a Bachelor of Social Science, planning to major in Sociology and Criminology. I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/gP3MuUTmXNk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Law & Order</a> is only partly responsible for this. However, after a few months of self study and just a few weeks of term, I quickly realised I'd misfired and didn't find the actual work as appealing as I'd thought.</p>
      <p>Back to work and the same problems came up again pretty quickly. Planning a career change the second time around, I tried to take a more introspective approach. I spent hours examining potential professions and trying to assess how I felt about the processes and outcomes of the job. I finally narrowed the choice down to computer programming or biomedical research. Both fields recognised a long ignored but bubbling interest in the overlap between technology, society and futurism. I started learning basic Biology, Chemistry and borrowed a dense book from my university library on "IT Systems".</p>
      <p>I struggled to make a decision on the grounds of greater interest, particularly from such a low base of experience. In the end the decision was made for me by external factors, as it was impractical to finance the 7+ years of full time study required to become an academic researcher.</p>
      <p>The transition to programming was almost too easy. Again, I quit my job, now two years after my original attempt. I self studied using some of the copious online resources available and following the guidance of my aforementioned brother. I quickly discovered the immense pleasure and satifaction that programming brings some people, was also available to me.</p>
      <p>After a month and a half of this, I began an intense 12 week accelerator course. It was <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of those</a> ~70 hour per week coding bootcamps presently in vogue and it was hugely effective for me. I lucked out and had an excellent instructor. I fully immersed myself and became sufficiently proficient over 12 weeks to get my first programming job as a back-end web developer using Ruby on Rails and the occasional smear of JavaScript.</p>
      <p class="inset">A warning; my experience is not universal amongst career changers. I am deeply suited to programming. I have a profound interest in the societal benefits made possible through technological development. I love logic, computer science, algorithms and I feel exhilarated rather than burdened by the immense, continually evolving body of knowledge required to be a decent developer. I'm not sure I'd recommend this path to someone who didn't feel similarly.</p>
      <p>After a year building websites and web apps of increasing complexity, learning rapidly under the tutelage of the generous and skilled <a href="https://github.com/buntine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew Buntine</a>, I received an offer to work on a greenfield project producing a new product for a SaaS company using an exciting, cutting edge tech stack. The new job offered focussed mentoring, a single, complex product to focus on, an increase in responsibility and a commensurate salary increase.</p>
      <p>I've now been employed at <a href="https://www.jcurve.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCurve Solutions</a> for some time, working primarily on that greenfield project. My love affair with programming continues unimpeded and I no longer consider my delayed entrance to the scene with regret. I've since learned that many skills from my previous career translate well and that I can bring valuable perspectives to my development practice that I wouldn't have without my unique experiences.</p>
      <p>Particularly, I value having come to this career with maturity, knowing that it is what I want to do. Professional maturity goes a long way in the workplace and the skills that get built up over a career in any profession are more important than is reflected by the inauthentic lip service they get paid. I have been able to learn and progress much more quickly that I would have straight out of university with a computer science degree.</p>
      <p>I know what it feels like to be less than enamoured with your job, uncertain and lost about the future. If work is an important part of life for you, it's debilitatiing. My professional life now has a clear direction and purpose to which I am able to fully commit. I enjoy working and learning every day. I spend (embarassingly huge) amounts of time learning and programming out of work hours, purely by choice.</p>
      <p>I am immensely grateful to those who have guided me along the way and continue to do so. A few people on that long list are the fantastic teacher of my course <a href="https://github.com/epoch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DT</a>, the previously mentioned Andrew Buntine, my current boss and superb mentor <a href="https://github.com/dnch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Cheail</a>, my impressive peers <a href="https://github.com/kiwwa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Shillabeer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Jayzz55" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jaya Wijono</a>. Finally, thanks to a constant source of support, perspective, information and still the best programmer I've ever met, my brother.</p>
