## Chapter Notes

### Get Out of Your Own Way

* use self-descriptive adjectives that convey power and eschew attitudes that, even if accurate, fairly or unfairly, diminish your status.
* [don't] begin an interaction by apologizing
* Self-awareness of where you sit in the ecosystem and what you need to do to win
* An important part of being "willing to do what it takes" is sticking with efforts to build power and get things done in the face opposition, criticism, obstacles, setbacks, and failures. Almost everyone, at some point in their lives and careers, will run into seemingly insurmountable obstacles and determined opponents who may unfairly deprecate others and spread misinformation about rivals. Because these difficulties are inevitable, I believe that persistence and resilience – sticking with things, while being sensible and changing strategies or approaches as necessary – frequently determine whether people will succeed in their rise to power.
* If you want power, you need to toughen up and become able to persist in the face of opposition and persevere even when confronted by setbacks.
* overconfidence causes people to appear more competent, and this perception of greater competence then causes overconfident individuals to enjoy advantages in the eyes of others.
* _the greatest gift that has been bestowed on them is that of shamelessness. Shamelessness is the superpower of a certain section of the English upper classes... The upper classes calmly parade on through the streets and boardrooms to claim the spoils. They don't learn shamelessness at Eton, but this is where they perfect it._
* To succeed, people need to be and feel agentic, and attempt to exercise influence and control.
    * described by some as a force of nature
    * swearing, getting angry
* _The Curse Of Authenticity:_ In their quest to be their authentic selves and display their real feelings and true opinions to others, people tell me that engaging in activities such as networking, flattering those in power, spending time ensuring that others know of their accomplishments, asking for resources, or presenting themselves to the world in a powerful fashion would not be true to who they really are.
* "... the act of making oneself vulnerable by sharing personal information about the self typically promotes liking and feelings of closeness." However, research also reveals the downsides of disclosing weaknesses, particularly in the case of task-oriented interactions for people in higher-status leadership roles.
* ...expressed to her people that she was nervous and unsure of herself... "her candour backfired; she lost credibility..."
* The combination of motivated cognition and people's generally poor ability to discern deceit means that inauthentic behaviour is unlikely to be uncovered – and even when it is, sanctions are likely to be either nonexistent or minimal.
* Leaders need allies and supporters; one of the primary tasks of a leader is to recruit both. This task is more readily accomplished if a leader is true not to themselves but instead to the needs and motivations of those they seek to recruit.
* Maybe it is the perception of similarity ... If you want others to support you, you need to be able to answer the question: What's in it for them if they do?
* So stop focusing on trying to figure out who you are. Instead, focus on who your allies and potential allies are. Become a student of the people whose support you need. The sooner you do, the faster you will develop the information and insights necessary for strategically building the alliances you need to succeed.
* The Paradox of Likeability
    * being liked is a source of power ... But worrying about being liked, being overly concerned with what others think about us, can get in the way of becoming powerful
    * (about Thatcher) ...she was 'almost impervious to how much she offends other people.'
    * being liked: you may be seen as less competent
    * the two fundamental aspects by which people judge others are warmth and competence... tendency to see warmth and competence ... as being negatively related
* first demonstrate competence. Then, if and when you show warmth, people will not see it as a sign of weakness but as something unexpected from a person with power.
* as people rise in organisations, they are evaluated on their ability to get things done, not so much on how nice they are.
* agreeableness was negatively related to various measures of career success and also to achieving less in negotiations
* disagreeableness had no effect on subsequent power – it neither helped nor hurt
    * more dominant-aggressive behaviour, a type of behaviour that Anderson and others consistently have found positively predicts power
    * fewer generous and communal behaviours, which negatively affected attaining power
* combination of humility to get others on your side, and also hubris
* understanding the importance of social connection but not letting the need for acceptance overwhelm what you want ... your own interests and agenda

### Break the Rules

* Breaking the rules ... meant fundamentally taking the initiative - not waiting to obtain permission or, for that matter, even asking for anyone's approval, but just creating things - in this case, an event.
* "When people have power, they act the part. Powerful people smile less, interrupt others, and speak in a louder voice... The powerful have fewer rules to follow."
* heuristic association between power and rule-breaking - the powerful are freer to defy social norms and conventions and get away with it
* There are obviously limits to the positive effect of norm violations on perceptions of power, but the idea that violating rules and social conventions might increase someone's power is a principle that ought to be taken seriously. This idea explains many aspects of social life in workplaces, not just in politics.
* surprise can work to the perpetrator's advantage, because others do not have time to prepare for the interaction and decide how they want to respond.
* _Okay, what works? Going to the top works ... Everybody in between doesn't matter. So I walked into the dean's office and asked if the dean was in. And the woman at the desk said, "He's in his office." I said "Thanks" and walked in. I said, "Dean, I'm Jason Calacanis. I've really enjoyed my years here but I am going to have to drop out." And he said, "Do you have an appointment?" I told him no but that I really needed to talk to him._
* Ask Forgiveness [Rather] Than Permission
    * most people are conflict averse and therefore seek to avoid arguments
    * resistance to what you want to do is likely to be less than you expect because people will be reluctant to confront you and risk a difficult interpersonal conversation
    * Once you have completed or accomplished something, it becomes a fait accompli and difficult to undo ... once anything is done, it is harder to undo - and that includes instituting awards, events, and ceremonies.
* Rules tend to favour the already strong
* Think outside the rules and don't let rules limit your thinking or options.
* Break the rules by asking for things
    * In addition to appearing inadequate or incompetent, most people fear the possibility of rejection.
    * requestors were overly focused on the cost of complying with the request and could not sufficiently put themselves in the place of the person receiving the request
    * "help seeking is uncomfortable" ... But people want to offer help.
    * Ask for more
    * Get used to asking, being turned down, and asking again, or for different things from different people.
    * Asking does break some rules, but it works.
* Rules and social conventions are made by those in power, mostly to ensure that their power is perpetuated.
* If you are going to win given the rules in place, by all means follow and advocate for those rules.

### Appear Powerful

* difference in their demeanour, language and approach ... Hayward is mostly apologetic and restrained, both verbally and physically, as he sits hunched over and uses few hand or arm movements. Blankfein is more confrontational and forceful in his self-presentation.
* How you "show up" is important, maybe even determinative, of your career trajectory, how much power and status others accord you
* Research shows that people form impressions of others, often precise assessments of personality, very quickly, using "thin slices" - just a few seconds - of behaviour. People then make subsequent decisions and judgements about others using those small snippets of behaviour. Research also demonstrates that even these quickly formed first impressions are surprisingly durable. Their persistence arises in part because of the pervasiveness of confirmation bias.
* if people think you are not too smart or competent, they will ask questions that preclude your demonstrating how much you know, and give you few opportunities to demonstrate your intelligence and competence
* You only get one chance to make a first impression
* (1) eye contact increases speakers' credibility, and the perception of their honesty; (2) the duration of eye contact affects observers' judgments of someone's potency, including their leadership; and (3) eye contact affects people's perceptions of the speaker's self-esteem and causes others to rate the speaker more favorably.
* reading that opening statement makes him appear scripted and insincere - maybe those words are not his own, provided by lawyers or staff
* Showing up without notes, appearing to be in command of the subject matter and the situation, is important.
* don't use notes or a lot of other props or cues, particularly things that would cause you not to make eye contact with the person or people you are speaking with
* instead of abrogating or minimising responsibility, leap to your active defense and that of others; change the conversation to be about the positive context you provide, why it's valuable
* Blankfein never once apologises for Goldman's actions or backs away from his argument about what market makers do and their right - indeed, responsibility - to engage in hedging activities, including shorting securities they have sold.
* nonverbal cues about energy, potency, confidence
* responding to how people appear
* competence, likability, maturity and trustworthiness
* "ratings of power-related traits from CEO's faces" ... were significantly related to company profits, as were the ratings of CEO's leadership.
* the connection between appearance and leader success has been uncovered in numerous domains besides business and is a reliable, replicated finding.
* by paying attention to grooming, colors and wardrobe choices
* facial expressions, body language, the words they use, and all the other aspects that go into "appearing powerful"
* People also mostly respond positively to signals of strength.
* Certain emotional displays convey strength, others do not. Therefore, it is important to convey powerful emotions and avoid expressing those that signal lower status.
* anger is a powerful emotion and that displaying it is often a smart power move
* expressing sadness or remorse and apologizing conveys much less power
* people who expressed anger more frequently had been promoted more, earned more, and scored higher on their managers' assessment of whether the employee should be promoted in the future.
* "Although anger expressions ... result in the perception that the expresser is unlikable and cold, likability was not related to status conferral.
* expressions of anger permitted people to claim greater value - and do better - in negotiations, because the expression of anger conveys toughness.
* apologizing "inherently associates a transgressor with wrongful behaviour."
* apology can affect people's self-perception
* the act of refusing to apologize "results in greater feeling of power/control, value integrity, and self-worth.
* Apology also affects what others believe about that social actor. Because apology is a low power behaviour, others will see entities that apologize as possessing less influence, status, and prestige
* polite communication reflects negatively on the speaker's perceived dominance, power, and assertiveness
* trade-offs in the social perception of people between being seen as warm or competent
* The Importance Of (Even Unwarranted) Self-Confidence
    * Research shows that emotions - and behaviours - are contagious
    * one of a leader's most important tasks is to project confidence
    * The importance of projecting confidence is why the first rule of power, in chapter one, was to lose the scripts, language, and (relevant to this chapter) body language that suggests anything other than self-confidence and potency
    * not only did a person's overconfidence predict their task partner's rating of their competence and, therefore, the status accorded them, overconfidence "had as strong a relationship with partner-rated competence as did actual ability."
    * the percentage of time someone spoke; the use of a confident, factual vocal tone; providing information relevant to the problem; adopting an expansive posture; exhibiting a calm and relaxed demeanour; and offering answers
* What to do depends on which motive is stronger in a given situation - the motive to associate with strength and success, or the motive to offer help and feel close with someone who has expressed vulnerability.
* in the context of task-oriented relationships, "that when higher status individuals self-disclosed a weakness, it led to lower influence ... greater perceived conflict ... less liking ... and less desire for a future relationship."
* These negative effects did not occur when the individual self-disclosing was a peer in terms of status.
* it is particularly important to demonstrate confidence - and competence - in task-oriented settings, especially when you hold a higher-status position and others expect you to provide leadership and reassurance.
* look up Dana Carney of Berkeley's Haas Business School review PSDom [power, status and dominance]
* Non-verbal behaviours actually associated with power, status and dominance
    * more gestures
    * more open body posture
    * less interpersonal (physical) distance
    * more controlled arm and hand gestures
    * louder voice
    * more successful interruptions of others
    * more speaking time
    * longer gazing time
    * higher visual dominance ratio (look + talk > look + listen)
    * more disinhibited laughs
* people can learn how to express power nonverbally, and can become more skilled at doing so through training, coaching, and practice.
* Powerful Speech - Powerful Words
    * Words shape how we think
    * Powerful speech consists of mostly one-syllable words and no complex sentence constructions with subordinate clauses.
    * Powerful speech is easy to understand.
    * Powerful speech also does not impose large cognitive burdens on the listener, but rather draws their conclusions for them in simple, easy-to-understand words.
    * absence of hedging words such as "sort of" or "kind of" and few hesitations such as "um" or "er"
    * a lack of polite forms
    * powerful words - words that evoke vivid images and arouse people's emotions - words such as "injured," "death," and "problem."
    * Powerful speakers make declarations instead of asking questions.
    * the final words in a sentence are important - you want to end strong
    * pauses and variations in pacing for emphasis and to hold the audience's attention
    * repeats ideas and themes
* answered the question he wanted rather than what was asked
* try the dominant and customarily successful approach unless and until that is proven not to work.
* master how to appear confident, attractive, and powerful in multiple ways.
* People are fundamentally trusting.
* When people tell stories about their lives and careers and personas, few - maybe no one - bothers to do the simple work of checking
* People become committed to their decisions. Once people have invested either financially or emotionally in a relationship, that commitment hinders their admitting they made a mistake in judgment.

### Build a Powerful Brand

* Chau ... started a podcast ... [which] gave her the opportunity and the right to ask women who were very senior in their careers or public companies to talk for an hour. Because most people said yes to her invitations, Chau expanded her network strategically and significantly. Moreover, her status was enhanced through her association ... with high status people.
* People are known partly by the company they keep.
* having a prominent friend in an organisation boosted an individual's reputation as a good performer.
* One way to build a powerful brand is to associate with other people and organisations that are themselves prestigious.
* Chau began running panels of about twenty people. "I'll pick a topic I'm trying to get smarter on," she says. "Then I'll find three senior operators, and I'll ask them to be a panelist. It's a way for me to build my network of operators, and then I'll go invite the twenty founders that are building companies in this space that I want to meet. In the panel, I get all of this content from the founders and the operators who are much more expert than I am, and develop it into a blog post I can put out."
* "By being out there and having this kind of brand, it makes it much easier for people to then say, 'come on my podcast,' or 'Will you sit on this panel, or do this keynote?'
* flywheel effect of personal branding
* They could stand out from the crowd. By doing so, their credibility, connections, and power would grow.
* Have a narrative - and tell it repeatedly
    * A brand needs coherence.
    * At its best and most effective, a brand brings together aspects of someone's personal and professional life in a way that makes it clear why they are uniquely qualified for some position or to found a company in a particular industry.
    * Everyone needs a brand. Your task: think of a short (two or three sentence) way of describing yourself and your accomplishments that brings together your expertise, your experience (what you have done), and a way of integrating that with some aspect of your personal story.
    * Once you develop a brand statement, get feedback on it from professional colleagues and friends. And then think about how you are going to get that message out into the world.
* a lie will go halfway around the world in the time it takes the truth to put on its shoes.
* the importance of getting your side of the story out early and often. Once impressions are formed, they are more difficult to change.
* Develop A Look
    * Standing out can be good; balance against signalling "one of us" - safer but doesn't make an impression.
    * using clothes and physical appearance as a part of branding
    * He sought to convey through his appearance - his look - that he should be taken seriously, that he had resources
* Do as many things as possible to become known
    * It is useful to match the outlets to the nature of the brand being promoted
* Podcasts
* Write a Book
* Conferences
* Cultivate the media
    * the self promotion dilemma. On one hand, people are expected to project confidence and expertise while claiming competence. In situations such as job interviews or making a pitch, self-promotion is virtually required - how else would the target know about your wonderful qualities? On the other, there is often social disapproval and dislike for people who are seemingly boastful and "braggadocious."
    * Research shows that if a person sings someone else's praises - even if that person has a financial incentive to do so, such as an agent - many of the downsides of self-promotion disappear.
* Stand out by being appropriately controversial
    * becoming newsworthy
    * An unobvious choice, a controversial position, draws attention.
* Leverage prestigious affiliations whenever possible
    * What could I join? Or leverage? Trinity?
    * If you have a job at a prestigious organisation, go beyond just adding it to your resume and public profile. Leverage that association to obtain connections to other high-status positions and organisations and build even more personal brand equity.
* Taking credit for your work
    * be willing to tell your story and eschewing any false sense of modesty or the belief that your work will speak for itself
    * Deborah Liu wound up getting more credit for a smaller product achievement than she did for something of greater economic significance, because she had created and told a narrative - repeatedly - that possessed all of the elements of what people want to hear.
* call it helping your manager understand the impact that you have, if you call it helping your team get the recognition it deserves


### Network Relentlessly

* performance was not that important and social relationships and sponsorship mattered more
* devote less time to the technical aspects of his job and more to building relationships with people both inside and outside of [company], so he could be more noticeable and known.
* networking made his excellent technical work and his intelligence and interpersonal skills more widely visible.
* Moreover, building relationships was completely consistent with the tasks of marketing and business development that constituted his job
    * where this isn't true for me, find proper justifications for such activity
* suggested the group go out for dinner - and he would pay for the meal. In a more informal atmosphere, his great ability to relate to people and his business smarts stood out, as there was less pressure.
* finding a place to work where he would learn and possibly develop a good relationship with a mentor
* his goal of leaving a legacy, of making an impact in the world, requires him to enlist the help of others, because he cannot accomplish what he wants to do by himself.
* Who you know, and how many people you know, matters for your influence and for your career.
* Spend enough time interacting with (useful) people
    * people spend a lot of time with the inner circle and not much time socialising for networking; you just need to do more
    * one reason that people don't engage in [networking] is that they don't find it enjoyable
        * so make it enjoyable for self and others!
* seeing networking as a task vs as a skill: when you are trying to build a skill, you are much more apt to be strategic or analytical about how you get better at it.
* networking for instrumental reasons ... results in better career outcomes
* a longitudinal field study ... found that "networking was the most robust predictor of career success."
* Another longitudinal study observed an effect of networking on both concurrent salary and the growth rate of salary over time as well as a relationship between networking and career satisfaction.
* networking ability dominated other aspects of political skill in its ability to explain career outcomes
* In a study of which political skill dimensions were the most important for career outcomes, such as work productivity, career success, personal reputation, and job satisfaction, networking ability was among the most important.
* it is easy to connect with Levy because he is intellectually curious ... smart and interested
* became determined to spend time among the "most exceptional people in our culture because I wanted to gain their knowledge and their habits to improve the quality of my life."
* think about bringing people into their lives
    * no one wanted another phone call, particularly from someone they did not know
    * "had to be generous, because I can't just be another person asking for something."
    * lower their defenses
* when people invested effort - in a person, in an activity - they cared about that entity more, because they see it as someone or some activity worthy of their effort.
* novelty causes people to explore and seek to understand their new experience
* "if you can curate an environment with high-profile people, they'll go out of their way to be there."
* "the most desired human or experiences" entail wonder.
* To create a sense of community, you need membership.
    * a clear line delineating inside and out, and maybe a common language, a shared history, a feeling of influence..."
* intentionality in how they have structured their social worlds that far exceeds that of most people
* Pursue your "Weak Ties"
    * ties that were most useful for finding a job were not the strong ties with family, friends and close work colleagues, but instead the ties with casual acquaintances - so-called weak ties.
    * Any tie is better than cold calling - hence the phrase, "warm introduction."
    * Often such casual, weak ties are sufficient to provide credibility
    * don't spend too much time with people who are close. Instead, ensure that you are meeting a wide variety of people in a wide variety of organisations and industries.
* Become a Broker
    * bring together parties who could profitably benefit from interacting with or knowing each other
    * opinion and behaviour are more homogenous within than between groups ... brokerage across the structural holes ... provides vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital.
    * outcomes are better for those whose networks bridge structural holes
    * network structure matters
    * "moving information between people to whom one is only connected indirectly - often has little or no value"
* Be Central
    * exposure to the senior executive team
    * interacted with numerous people and units across the organisation ... profound informational advantages
    * Centrality affects visibility.
    * becoming the focal point for information and opportunities
    * when people evaluate jobs and roles, one dimension they should account for is the centrality that will accrue to them
* Create Value for Others
    * Sometimes this idea is described as being generous.
    * putting yourself in the other's place, having some empathetic understanding of where they are coming from and what challenges they face, so that you can provide help reasonably easily and effectively.
    * norm of reciprocity
    * Help also binds people together through liking
* If you want to get value from your connection to another, don't make that other do your thinking for you. ... be specific ... or the response won't be as favorable because the request is too general and untargeted.
* Networking Time Management
    * Technology can help ... not as good as a more personal connection, but as a way of keeping in touch, better than nothing
    * use relationship management software
    * sustaining a relationship, particularly a weak tie, does not require intense or deep connections. Casual updates, sharing an interesting article about a topic of mutual interest, or letting people know you are thinking about them is often sufficient.
    * calling him every year on his birthday.
    * balance investing in building a social network with harvesting the results of those efforts
        * It is the extremely rare person who has properly solved the network growth to network value extraction ratio. But those few that have rise to the top very fast - and stay there.
    * spend more time with those on the periphery than at the center, more time on people distant than on those who were close.
        * why would you want to double down on somebody who's already in?
    * leveraging technology and maybe building a staff (after all, hiring help is often not that expensive) - to become more time efficient in networking.
* Consider how you spend your time. Are you devoting enough time to building social relationships? And with whom? Brokerage relationships? High-status others?
* learn about how to see social capital
