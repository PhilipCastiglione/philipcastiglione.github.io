# Career Progression

Attach to a profit centre, not a cost center.

# Negotiation

Understand your BATNA and expose (elements of) it tactically to reveal a strong negotiating position.

Don't be needy.

Delay/defer when you need time.

## Salary

Resist stating a number! Before you negotiate salary get agreement in principle that they will hire you if you can strike a mutually beneficial deal (so they are invested)
* counter-point; Sean found this problematic at senior levels because they will want to ensure the ballpark is correct so as not to waste time.

Negotiate on more than just base salary: signing bonus, stock/options/RSUs, annual leave, perks, pension contribution, health insurance, allowances (eg car), ... There are no non-negotiable things really.
