# Salary Negotiation: Make More Money, Be More Valued

_by Patrick McKenzie_

[Source](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/)

It's even more important than your real estate transactions.

Salary negotiations are very asymmetrical. Companies know this and routinely exploit it.

Virtually any amount of money available to you personally is mouse droppings to your prospective employer. They will not feel offended if you ask for it.

It is Bob’s job to get you signed with the company as cheaply as possible, but Bob is not super motivated to do so, because Bob is not spending Bob’s money to hire you. In fact, there are many organizations (and Bobs) for whom power, status, and money come from asking for more budget every year.

Internalize this: everyone in this discussion is a businessman. (Some might call themselves “regular employees,” which just means they’re businessmen with self-confidence issues and poor business skills.)

The desirable process:

* (Optional but recommended) Establish a reputation in your field as someone who delivers measurable results vis-a-vis improving revenue or reducing costs.
* Have a hiring manager talk with you, specifically, about an opening that they want you, specifically, to fill.
* Talk informally (and then possibly formally) and come to the conclusion that this would be a great thing if both sides could come to a mutually fulfilling offer.
* Let them take a stab at what that mutually fulfilling offer would look like.
* Suggest ways that they could improve it such that the path is cleared for you doing that voodoo that you do so well to improve their revenue and/or reduce their costs.
* (Optional) Give the guy hiring you a resume to send to HR, for their records. Nobody will read it, because resumes are an institution created to mean that no one has to read resumes. Since no one will read it, we put it in the process where it literally doesn’t matter whether it happens or not, because if you had your job offer contingent on a document that everyone knows no one reads, that would be pretty effing stupid now wouldn’t it.

There are no non-negotiable rules:

* Ironclad non-compete with an IP assignment provision of major multinational… struck from the contract with four sentences of discussion.
* Major popular tech employer offered desirable employee $X as a salary because “it was the max the HR department allows for that position.” He got hired that week at $2X. All parties — hiring organization, HR, and employee — think they pulled one over on the other participants.

Only negotiate salary after you have agreement in principle from someone with hiring authority that, if a mutually acceptable compensation can be agreed upon, you will be hired. This way they're already invested.

You do not start negotiating until you already have a Yes-If.

The ideal resolution to the job interview is for both sides to be optimistic about the arrangement, and then you close with a warm handshake and “I look forward to receiving your offer by, oh, would tomorrow be enough time for you to run the numbers?”

**The First Rule Is What Everyone Tells You It Is: Never Give A Number First**

When people with hiring authority think of winners, they think of people like them who live and breathe this business thing. They negotiate things as a matter of course: that is a major portion of the value they bring to the company. Volunteering a number presents you as catastrophically incompetent.

**Objection:** “I really need a number to move the process forward.”

**What you should think:** “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”

**What you should say:** “I’m more concerned at the moment with talking to you about discovering whether we’re a mutual fit. If we’re a great fit, then I can be flexible on the numbers with you and you can be flexible on the numbers with me. If we’re not a great fit, then the numbers are ultimately irrelevant, because your company only hires A players and I only work at roles I would be an A player at.”

---

**Objection:** “This form needs a number.”

**What you should think:** “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”

**What you should say:** “Give me git access and I’ll fix it in a jiffy! [both people laugh] No, seriously, speaking, I’m more concerned at the moment with discovering whether we’re a mutual fit… Oh, it’s physically impossible? Put in $1 then to get the ball rolling, and we’ll circle back to this later.”

---

**Objection:** “We want to figure out whether you’re an appropriate candidate for the position.”

**What you should think:** “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”

**What you should say:** “It’s so important to me that this is a good mutual fit for us. Let’s talk about why I’m a great fit for this position: I know you’re concerned about $FILL_IN_THE_BLANK. In addition to my previous successes doing it, I have some great ideas for what I’d do about that if I was working at your company. Would you like to drill into those or is there another job area you’re more concerned about to start with?”

---

**Objection:** “I’m sorry, great try at a dodge there, but I just can’t go forward without a number.”

**What you should think:** “You’re lying to me to attempt to get me to compromise my negotiating position.”

**What you should say:** “Well, you know, I would hate to have to walk away from the negotiation over this. Working with your company looked like it would have been such a wonderful opportunity. I hear the hiring market is super-tight right now, would you like me to introduce you to other candidates? Maybe we can shave a couple of months off of you filling this position.”

We’ll give the company a pass on the “what’s your number?” question because it is an established social ritual that they get one free pass at screwing you. You still don’t have to cooperate with it, though.

Listen To What People Tell You. Repeat It Back To Them.

Take notes during job interviews and salary negotiations. (Make sure you can take notes without playing with your pen or otherwise appearing to fidget.) ...focus on specific words they use and concerns they have so that you can come back to them later in the conversation.

If they say the position has been open for six months, take a note of that.  During the salary negotiation, if they have a pricing objection, one of your first responses should be “I appreciate that this is a little more money than you might have been thinking about, but this is an opportunity to get this position filled without delaying your business by another six months. What is the value of that six months of execution to you?”

Have a strong [BATNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_alternative_to_a_negotiated_agreement)

Instead of being needy, aim for “I’m enthusiastic about the opportunity with working with you, assuming we can come to mutually satisfactory terms.”

Micro-tip: Notice how often I say “We” and variations on “mutual win.”  Those work pretty well.  The only thing better than “We” is “You” (and variants), because people care a heck of a lot more about their problems than about your problems.

Research, Research, Research

You should, before any job interview, have intimate knowledge of the target company.  Prospective peers within the company are one obvious way to get it.  So are ex-employees, folks who’ve had dealings with them professionally, etc.

Key things you want to learn:

* What do they value?
* Who do they value within the company?  (Roles?  Titles?  Groups?)
* What does the career path look like for successful people within the company?
* Roughly speaking, how generous are they with regard to axes that you care about?
* Do they have any compensation levers which are anomalously easy to operate?  (For example, if you asked around, you might hear a few people say that a particular firm pushes back modestly on out-of-band increases in salary but they’ll give in-the-money option grants like candy.)
* All the fuzzy stuff: what’s the corporate culture like?  Yadda yadda.

New Information Is Valuable And Can Be Traded For Things You Want

Holding back some lines can help in the negotiation.

**Company:** We can’t see our way to $88,000.

**Applicant:** Well, I know you do a significant amount of business with your online store.  At my last company, I increased sales by 3% by $YADDA_YADDA.  What would a 1% increase in sales be worth to you?

Salary is only one component of the package. Work it up, then table it when you reach an impasse, to be returned to later. You can then trade improvements for concessions (or apparent concessions) on the earlier topic.

**Employer:** “We were thinking $80,000.”

**Applicant:** “$80,000 is interesting™ but not quite where we need to be to get this done.  Do you have any flexibility on that number?”

**Employer:** “I think I can convince HR to approve $84,000 but that is the best I can do.”

**Applicant:** “I appreciate that.  $84,000, huh.  Well, it isn’t quite what I had in mind, but the right package offer could make that attractive.  How much vacation comes with the package?”

**Employer:** “20 days a year.”

**Applicant:** “If you could do 24 days a year, I could compromise on $84,000.”

Hopping around the offer also helps you defuse common negotiating tactics like “I have to go to $EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY to get approval of that.”
Have your own $EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY.

If you get "I'd love to do more but HR just won't let me" (on eg. salary), express sympathy, because they just said they want to give you more but can’t, then refocus the discussion on things which are within their personal authority. (other package elements, or other desirable job features)
