# Spatial Design

An underdeveloped interest in the design of buildings and spaces.

## Architecture

I love brutalist architecture:

## Public Spaces & Urban Design

Unique Modernist-Yugoslav monuments (Spomeniki in Slovenian, Spomenici in Croatian) that were built in the 60s and 80s throughout what used to be the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
