# Tea 

Despite living in Melbourne for 10 years, I still have pretty plebian taste in coffee. Friends are aghast at the home brand instant coffee in our pantry.

I'm more drawn to the world of tea!

So far, some favourites include:

* Russian Caravan (the combination of Lapsang Souchong and Keemun and/or Oolong)
* Fancy Japanese Green Tea
* White Tea (young buds and leaves)
* Rooibos (caffeine-free herbal tea from South Africa)
