# Tea 

Despite living in Melbourne for 10 years, I still have pretty plebian taste in coffee. Friends are aghast at the home brand instant coffee in our pantry.

I'm more drawn to the world of tea!

> There are six main types of tea — green, black, white, yellow, oolong and dark tea — all of which are made from the Camellia sinensis plant.
> 
> It is believed to have originated in north-east India, north Myanmar and south-west China, where the UN says there is evidence of tea being consumed 5,000 years ago.
> 
> The varieties are reflective of different harvesting and processing methods, such as pan frying, steaming, rolling, and different fermentation techniques.
