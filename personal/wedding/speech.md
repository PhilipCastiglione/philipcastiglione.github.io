Hello everyone,

---

Firstly, on behalf of Gráinne and myself I’d like to thank Clontarf Castle and the team for your expert organising and hosting. Your care and flexibility have helped make this day perfect for us. Now we’ll be able to impress all the Australians by saying we had our wedding in a castle in Europe.

---

I’d like also to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed readings and musical performances and a special thank you to Alan for your efforts and skill with the camera and to Johnno as well for the video.

Now onto the wedding party.

Starting with the best man, my brother Thomas. You are a constant source of happiness, interesting conversation and friendship in my life and I’m very glad you’re here.

To the jet-setting groomsmen Fauzi, Luke and our esteemed master of ceremonies Rhys, who have flown in from Melbourne, Seattle and Perth respectively. Though you arrived here from different places, what you each have in common is that we’ve seen one another through great times and challenging times. Each one of you has proven your character to me on countless occasions and I’m grateful to have you as friends.

A big thank you to the maid of honour and bridesmaids Claire, Christina and Ava. Gráinne has appreciated your help making this whole experience fun. That hens party looked brilliant from the little video I saw, I know how much Gráinne enjoyed it from the evidence of her two day recovery. I must say I’m immensely proud of Gráinne for winning the wellie throw.

It’s conventional at this point in the evening to thank you all for attending our wedding. We’re a bit embarrassed and very grateful for the fact that all of you are turning up, for us.

While writing this speech that got me thinking a bit. What makes a wedding special, why is it that you’re all attending? It became clear to me that this question answers itself. Let me explain.

If Gráinne and I were the only people here, smiling into each other’s eyes and professing our love to one another, well that could be a regular Tuesday for us. And even if the two of us went alone to the church together, had the ceremony, came here for a lovely dinner - that would be a wonderful day and we’d still end up married. But difference here is all of you. Having all of you - friends, family, our community, having you here transforms today into both a public event as well as a rite of passage. 

To those of you who travelled internationally to be here, thank you so much. We don’t take lightly how significant that is. And to all of you from all over the country and from all over Dublin - to each and every one of you, it’s your presence, spirit and good cheer filling the room with joy and making this a day that we will remember for the rest of our lives.

Today represents a merging of two families from opposite sides of the globe.

I met many members of Gráinne’s family on the day of her 30th birthday, and they offered the warmest and most generous welcome. Anne and John welcomed me into their home, and have plied me with food, tea and the odd whiskey many times since. I am immensely grateful for your generosity and kindness.

Thank you to my Mum, Victoria for your unconditional support and love, for allowing me to go out into the world and explore on my own terms and always being there with a smile when I came back with either a trophy or bruises for me efforts. I sometimes took my time finding my way, but in this case the winding path led me exactly where, and to whom, it was supposed to.

---

Gráinne. I am delighted to be your husband. 

You are a beautiful bride, truly, inside and out and it’s the proudest achievement of my 35 years on this earth that I can now call you my wife.

Your kindness, generosity, integrity and joyfulness improves the life of every person you come into contact with. Everyone in this room can attest to that.

How lucky I am, that I get to be the one to marry you and spend my whole life with you.

Thank you for being the person you are, and thank you for saying yes.

Now it’s time to get the party started so please let your hair down, enjoy yourselves and when the band starts up in a little while make your way to the dance floor and join us in throwing a few wedding shapes. Have a great time everybody!
