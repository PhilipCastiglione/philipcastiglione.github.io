    <p>management philosophy</p>

    <p>Here are my beliefs about management.</p>
    <p>I believe in bringing the rigour of engineering to the science of effective management.</p>
    <p>I believe in honour and integrity in the workplace, as in life.</p>
    <p>I believe in the power of radical candour and aspire towards radical transparency.</p>

    <p>academia, theory... BCompSc(Cognitive Science), BCom(Finance)</p>

        with most of the awards) and a Bachelor of Commmerce &mdash; Finance (WAM 85%, multiple awards).</p>

    <h4>10 years in software and 10 in finance and management consulting. All of them spent thinking and learning.</h4>
    <h4>I've managed (and lead) teams across a variety of organisations. Made and fixed many mistakes.</h4>
