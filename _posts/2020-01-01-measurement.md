### OKRs

A tool used to drive behaviour change by focusing around quantifiable metrics. These should generally not be organisation wide, on the basis that people at different levels in the organisation cannot influence the same things. It is also safest to make them temporary since initiating behaviour change is the point. The longer they stick around, the less effective they will be.

### KPIs

Metrics important to monitor. KPIs should not be used to directly influence behaviour, they should be observed as a reflection of the result of changes only. Individuals incentives should not align with KPIs or they will become ineffective.

## Discussion

Some part of my views are not conventional.
    
The important thing about OKRs in my opinion is that they should be an intentional tool used to drive a behaviour change.

They're not a passive metric (this is actually the theoretical difference between OKRs and KPIs, though those secretly modify behaviour too; OKRs are just explicit about that. KPIs can have some use and are another discussion).

I think they're often done wrong and cause problems; it can be hard to say if the problems outweigh the intended effects. The nastiest risk is gamified solutions that hit the OKR but aren't the desired behaviour ("want less bugs? make it harder for customers to report them! or just fire all your programmers!").

Personally I think the key is to use them as a very targeted tool, even a short term one. Set an OKR to train a new set of behaviours then retire it once some target change has taken effect.

Oh and most people shouldn't care about OKRs, they're a management tool. Why (it’s a controversial statement)?

Here's my view: most people working on their job don't really care about some management numbers, and you can't make them do anything other than briefly pretend to care.

As evidence, I submit the fact that (I believe) a lot of people agree with the tweet Patrick started this discussion with.

An exception is where you tie an OKR to something an individual actually does care about, which should be very specific to their own job, and within their influence (eg. sales targets for individual people rolled up into division/business unit targets). But personally I think it's quite rare that one numerical goal makes a lot of sense to drive behaviour change at multiple different levels within a business.

I should qualify that I'm talking about orgs over a certain size; big enough that people on the coalface feel disconnected from leadership
    

The bigger a company gets, the more abstract and inaccurate measures of progress get (eg [doing the actual work & the players have the thing] → [story points burning down on a chart]).
