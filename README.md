# README

This is the source code for my personal website.

Live at: https://philipcastiglione.com

I am using Jekyll for static site generation.

## Blog

Writing style should be

My preferred writing style is:

* Very concise; every line should be valuable
* Incisive; get to the heart of things
* Simple and direct without jargon, slang or colloquial language 
* No waffling business jargon that doesn't mean much
* Wise and intelligent through the content delivered

Posts should be as short as possible to deliver the maximum value for the readers time
With a mechanism for hiding longer explorations (eg footnotes) that I really can't avoid
