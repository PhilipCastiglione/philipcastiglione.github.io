      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I am deeply interested in programming. I believe in using computers to create things of practical value. I believe the profession I belong to offers a unique opportunity to create disproportionate value relative to effort and is one of the essential ingredients of modern progress.</p>
      <p>Professionally, this interest has led me to software development. I work on and learn about developing products, process automation, deployment infrastructure, solution optimisation and a range of other technical subjects.</p>
      <p>My eventual goal is to work on artificial intelligence R&D. AI is a broad church and requires many skills. This might take the form of applying machine learning strategies to improve the customer experience offered by a popular website, or it might be working on enhancing the processing of sensory input to better prepare self-driving cars for diverse environments.</p>
      <p>Though the precise destination isn't yet known, I dedicate a substantial portion of my time outside paid working hours developing skills that might lead me towards this goal.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>The largest and most interesting project that I have worked on to date is the greenfield project that currently occupies 90% of my role at my place of work, ASX listed SaaS provider <a href="http://www.jcurve.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JCurve Solutions</a>. The project is cloud based multi-tenented business software delivered as a service. The software architecture comprises of two primary applications supported by a number of microservices.<p>
      <p>The application I have spent most time on is the API. The API is a seperate application to support whitelabel licensing and is designed to be modern, stateless, RESTful and resource oriented.</p>
      <p>The API is built in Ruby and is nominally running Rails, though certain key aspects of the architecture have been customised. Postgres provides the persistence layer and Redis provides caching. As the product is new, we have the luxury of using edge versions in our stack.</p>
      <p class="inset">Since the product is proprietary it wouldn't be appropriate to provide specific details about it's design, but for more detail about the technologies I've encountered both on and off the clock, refer to the <a href="./skills.html">skills</a> page.</p>
      <p>Past projects contributed to include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a large corporate website for an ASX listed company (market cap ~$8bn)</li>
        <li>several ruby gems built as internal developer tools</li>
        <li>numerous websites and web applications of varying size and complexity</li>
      </ul>
