### Consultation vs Top Down

Decision making inclusivity vs hierarchical is situational

Lessons on consultation, a double edged sword. RE: a values update process at previous employer. The assessment thing is very subjective and I haven't reached the same conclusions as the 4 execs in the room. Subsequently, and given the follow on process where I just email Adam my feedback, I feel it's likely I won't have a significant voice *compared with those 4 individual people* about how our values develop. If there was a big vote across the company that went against something I preferred, I'd accept that with good reason. However it feels worse to just not have been one of the execs, so not having my preferences considered as strongly as the individuals with position.

Beware the loudmouth perspective.
