## Overview

The Lightning Decision Jam (LDJ) is a group workshop activity that can be used to generate improvements, solve problems, ideate suggestions and similar tasks.

TODO What it is good for
TODO When you should use it [cross link to collaborative vs top down decisions piece]

TODO What it is bad for

## How It Works

LDJ is moderator driven; an experienced moderator can make a big difference in facilitating productive sessions.

### Structure

This is an example structure that works well, but it's pretty tweakable to context.

1. Introduce the workshop process and goal
1. Enumerate the good
1. ...And the bad
1. Prioritise the problems
1. Reframe them as challenges
1. Ideate solutions
1. Prioritise solutions
1. Analyze Impact/Effort
1. Develop actions
