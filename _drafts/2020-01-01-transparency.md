### Full Transparency vs Curation

Transparency is a great principle, but there are risks, or at least flawed implementations. The <past employer> office move: Teams of *dozens* of people sitting around hearing bullshit "working groups", "promising good material updates to come at end of x date". This is not the way to do it. What are they doing? Who is failing?

QH team forum: Format means that necessarily 90% of the people only care about 10% of the content. Or maybe the very high level for more than that. Beware self-praising opportunities.

Just be honest and clear, explain major factors. Hotdesking discussion.

UPDATE -> This actually upset people!!! What assumptions I made that were wrong? People don't want to know? But I can't believe that the solution is the information hiding game and politician crap...
